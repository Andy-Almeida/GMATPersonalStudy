General Section Notes
	Quantatative
		Algebra and Basic Arithmetic - Can be brushed up in Math Review Section

Quick Tip (Read Before Exam)
	Finish the Test, dont get stuck on a question
	Best Guess and move on
	I can bookmark as many questions as I like, to see how they did later
	I can only change answers to three questions per section

General Notes and Ideas
	The first 10 questions do not determine the exam, it will balance out over the course of the test
	Calculator not allowed, so when studying, do not use one

Verbal Reasoning
	What Reading Comprehension Questions Measure
		Identify Stated Idea 
			- understand the passage as a whole and its constituent parts.
			- No need to do anything further with the information

		Identify Inferred Idea
			- use information in a passage for purposes
			- inferring additional information or the basis of what is given
			- applying the information to further contexts
			- critiquing the views expressed in the passage
			- evaluating the ways in which the writing is structured

	Five Types of Reading Comprehension Questions
		Main Idea Questions
			- Recognize an accurate statement of the main idea
			- Identify the authors primary purpose in writing it
			- Assign a title that accurately summarizes the main idea	

		Supporting Idea Questions
			- Asked about facts cited in a passage
			- Specific content of the arguments authors present ot support thier views
			- Descriptive details that support or elobrate on the main idea
			- Determine the meanings of individual sentences and paragraphs that contribute to the meaning of the passage as a whole
			- Pro Tip: See them as asking for the main point of one small part of the passage
		
		Inference Questions
			- Ideas that aren't explicitly stated in a passage but I can reasonably conclude are correct
			- Determine further conclusions or subtle meanings those words imply
			- "If I accept the truth of what the author says, what else would have to be-or would most likely be-true?"
			- Infer, based on context, the intended meaning of a word used figuratively or in a nonstandard way.

		Application Questions
			- The ability to figure out the relationships between situations or ideas a passage presents and other situations or ideas the passage doesn't directly address.
			- Examples:
				- Describe a hypothetical situation and ask you to infer from the passage what the author's opinion of that situation would most likely be
				- Ask you to recognize a situation or concept that is analogous to a situation or concept expressed in the passage
				- Require you to apply a principle expressed or implied in the passage to a different situation
				- Ask you to recognize implications that a bit of new, hyupothetical information would have for the reasoning in the passage.

		Evaluation
			- Analyze and evaluate a passage's organization and logiv.
			- How a passage is constructed or what strategies authors' use to try to persuade readers toa ccept their assertions
			- Assess the strengths and weaknesses of thier arguments
