Verbal Reasoning
	What Reading Comprehension Questions Measure
		Identify Stated Idea 
			- understand the passage as a whole and its constituent parts.
			- No need to do anything further with the information

		Identify Inferred Idea
			- use information in a passage for purposes
			- inferring additional information or the basis of what is given
			- applying the information to further contexts
			- critiquing the views expressed in the passage
			- evaluating the ways in which the writing is structured

	Five Types of Reading Comprehension Questions
		Main Idea Questions
			- Recognize an accurate statement of the main idea
			- Identify the authors primary purpose in writing it
			- Assign a title that accurately summarizes the main idea	

		Supporting Idea Questions
			- Asked about facts cited in a passage
			- Specific content of the arguments authors present ot support thier views
			- Descriptive details that support or elobrate on the main idea
			- Determine the meanings of individual sentences and paragraphs that contribute to the meaning of the passage as a whole
			- Pro Tip: See them as asking for the main point of one small part of the passage
		
		Inference Questions
			- Ideas that aren't explicitly stated in a passage but I can reasonably conclude are correct
			- Determine further conclusions or subtle meanings those words imply
			- "If I accept the truth of what the author says, what else would have to be-or would most likely be-true?"
			- Infer, based on context, the intended meaning of a word used figuratively or in a nonstandard way.

		Application Questions
			- The ability to figure out the relationships between situations or ideas a passage presents and other situations or ideas the passage doesn't directly address.
			- Examples:
				- Describe a hypothetical situation and ask you to infer from the passage what the author's opinion of that situation would most likely be
				- Ask you to recognize a situation or concept that is analogous to a situation or concept expressed in the passage
				- Require you to apply a principle expressed or implied in the passage to a different situation
				- Ask you to recognize implications that a bit of new, hyupothetical information would have for the reasoning in the passage.

		Evaluation
			- Analyze and evaluate a passage's organization and logiv.
			- How a passage is constructed or what strategies authors' use to try to persuade readers toa ccept their assertions
			- Assess the strengths and weaknesses of thier arguments

	Critical Reasoning
		Analysis - test skill in understanding a piece of logical reasoning as a whole and identifying the relationships among its constituent parts
		Construction - forming cogent arguments, ex: determine additional information that can be inferred from given info, or what additional info would be needed for an argument to work
		Critique - challenging the cogency of arguments, identifying strengths and weaknesses, determining how they could be improved
		Plan - designed to test skill in constructing and critiquing arguments about proposed courses of action.	

	Types of Critical Reasoning Questions
		Argument Construction
			- Basic argument structure
			- Properly drawn conclusions
			- Underlying assumptions
			- Well-supported explanatory hypotheses
			- Parallels between structurally similar arguments
		
		Argument Evaluation
			- Factors that would stregnthen or weaken the argument
			- Reasoning errors committed in making the argument
			- Aspects of the method by which the argument proceeds
		
		Questions about formulating and evaluating a plan of action
			- The relative appropriateness, effectiveness, or efficiency of different plans of action
			- Factors that would strengthen or weaken the prospects of succuess for a propsed plan of action
			- Assumptions underlying a proposed plan of action
	
	Strategies
		Be certain I understand the statement or set of statements on which a question is based
			Pay attention to :
			- What is put forward as factual information
			- What is not said but necessarily follows from what is said
			- What is claimed to follow from facts that have been put forward
			- How well those claims are substantiated
		If a question is based on an argument, identify which part of the argument is its conclusion
		Determine exactly what the question is asking
		Read all the answer choices carefully
		
Data Insights
	Data Types
		Text passages
		Tables
		Graphics
		Some combination
		
	Strategies
		Don't expect to be completely familiar with the material presented in Multi-Source Reasoning sets
		Analyze each source of info carefully, as the questions require detailed understanding of the information presented
		Read the quesitons carefully, making sure you understand whta they ask
		Examine the table and accompanying text to determine the type of information provided
		Read the question carefully
		Read each phrase, statement, numerical value, or algebraic expression carefully to determine the data analysis required
		Judge each phrase, statemnet, numerical value, or algebraic expression carefully on the basis of the condition specified
		
	Data Sufficiency
		Measure
			- Analyze a quantitative problem
			- Recognize which information is relevant
			- Determine at what point there is enough information to solve the problem

		Directions
			Each problem consists of a question and two statements (1) and (2)
			Using the data given int eh statements, plus basic knowdlege, decide whether you've been given enough data in the statements to answer the question asked
				- (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient to answer the question
				- (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient to answer the question
				- BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient
				- EACH statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question
				- Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient to answer the question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.
			Node: If a Data Sufficiency problem asks for a specific value, the data in the statements are sufficient only when tehy allow you to deteremine one precise value ratehr than a range of values
		
		Strategies
			Determine whether it's necessary to solve the problem
				- The answers I will select ask only if I have enough information. In some cases you may need to work the problem through
				- First consider if each statement separately gives enough information to solve the problem. disregard the other statement when evaluating
				- If either, or both, of the statements gives enough to solve the porblem, then tahts your answer
				- If neither statement ALONE is sufficient, consider the information in both statemnet (1) and statement (2) together.
			Decide whether the problem allows only one value or a range of values
			Avoid making unwarranted assumptions based on geometric figures
				- Figures are not necessarily drawn to scale
				- Ex: if a figure described as a rectangle looks as if it might be a square, don't assume it's a square just by looking at the figure
			
Full Quantitative Study
	Linear Equations	
		C. If two linear equations with the same two unknowns are equivalent, they have infinitely many solutions
			ex: 3x-y=6 and 6x-2y=12 -> Infinitely Many solutions.

		   If two linear equations with the same two unknowns aren't equivalent, they have at most one solution
			ex: 3x-y=6 and 4x-3y=12 -> at most one solution

		   If in solving them, you get
			0=0 or 1=1 : Infinite many solutions
			1/=0 : (Contradiction) No solution	
			Ex: 3x + 4y = 17
			    6x + 8y = 35
			Ans: No solution
			Why: The first line implies that 6x + 8y = 34 and that is just not the case here
			     No values of x and y can satisfy both equations

		   If neither a trivial equation nor a contradiction is reached, a unique solution can be found

		D. Solving By Subtitution
		   Ex: 3x + 2y = 11
		        x - y = 2

		       equation (2) converts ->  x = y + 2
		       plug (2) into (1) -> 3(y + 2) + 2y = 11
					    3y + 6 + 2y = 11
					    5y = 5
					    y = 1
			with y = 1, I can plug y into x - y = 2 -> x - 1 = 2 -> x = 3
		       
		E. Solving By Subtraction
		   Ex: 6x + 5y = 29 --> 18x + 15y = 87
		       4x + 3y = -6 --> 20x - 15y =-30
			              +_______________
					38x +  0y = 57 -> x = 3/2	
			With x, solve for y

	Factoring and Quadratic Equations
		A. Move everything to one side to make it equal to 0
		ex: x³ - 2x² + x = - 5(x - 1)²
		    x³ - 2x² + x + 5(x - 1)² = 0
		    x(x² - 2x + 1) + 5(x - 1)² = 0
		    x(x - 1)² + 5(x - 1)² = 0
		    (x + 5)(x - 1)² = 0
		    (x + 5) = 0  or  (x - 1)² = 0
		     x + 5  = 0        x - 1  = 0
		     x = -5	       x = 1

		B. Note that a fraction equals 0 if and only if its numerator equals 0 and its denominator doesn't
		ex:  x(x - 3)(x² + 5)
		     ---------------- = 0
			  x - 4
		     The numerator must equal 0: x(x - 3)(x² + 5) = 0
		     Thus, x      = 0     So, x = 0
			   x - 3  = 0       , x = 3
			   x² + 5 = 0       , no real solution
		     Solution:  x = 0,3

		C. Quadratic Equation Standard Form: ax² + bx + c = 0
		ex: x² + 6x + 5 = 0
		   3x² - 2x     = 0
		    x² + 4      = 0
	
		D. Some quadratic equations are easily solved by refactoring
		ex(1): x² + 6x + 5 = 0
		      (x + 5)(x + 1) = 0
		      x + 5 = 0  or  x + 1 = 0
		      x = -5	     x = -1
		
		ex(2): 3x² - 3 = 8x
		       3x² - 8x - 3 = 0
		      (3x + 1)(x - 3) = 0
		       3x + 1 = 0  or  x - 3 = 0
		       3x = -1         x = 3
		       x = -1/3	

		E. A quadratic equation ahs at most two real roots but may have kst one or even no root
		ex(1): x² - 6x + 9 = 0 
		      (x - 3)² = 0
		      (x - 3)(x - 3) = 0 so, only root is 3

		ex(2): x² + 4 = 0 no real root

		F. An expression of the form a² - b² can be factored as (a - b)(a + b)
		ex: 9x² - 25 = 0 
		    (3x - 5)(3x + 5) = 0
		    3x - 5 = 0  or  3x + 5 = 0
		    x = 5/3     or  x = -5/3

		G. If a quadratic expression isn't easily factored, we can still find its roots with the quadratic formula.
		If ax² + bx + c = 0 and a /= 0, the roots are
		     -b + sqrt(b² - 4ac)	       -b - sqrt(b² - 4ac) 
		x = --------------------   and    x = --------------------
			     2a				       2a

		If b² - 4ac > 0	, the two roots will be distinct real numbers
		If b² - 4ac > 0	, the two roots will be equal - b/2a, so there will only be one root
		If b² - 4ac > 0	, the two roots will have no real root since sqrt(b² - 4ac) will not be a real number

	Inequalities
		A. an intequality is a statement with one of these symbols:
			/= is not equal to
			>  is greater than
			>= is greater than or equal to
			<  is less than
			<= is less than or equal to
			
			ex: 5x-3 < 9 and 6x >= y

		B. Solve a linear equlity with one unknown like you solve a linear equation
		Isolate the unknown on one side. 
		All artihmetic is the same, add/subtract to both sides, multiply/divide both sides
		Note: Multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the order of the inequality
			ex: 6 > 2 but (-1)(6) < (-1)(2)
		ex(1): 3x - 2 > 5
		       3x     > 7
		       x      > 7/3
	
			5x - 1
		ex(2):  ------ < 3
			  -2
		
			5x - 1 > -6
			5x     > -5
			x      > -1

	Functions
		A. An algebraic expression in one variable can define a function of that variable.
		Written as a letter like f or g along the variable in the expression.
		ex(1): x³ - 5x² + 2 can define a function written as f(x) = x³ - 5x² + 2
			  2z + 7				     2z + 7
		ex(2): ------------  and define a function g(z) = ------------ 
			sqrt(z + 1)				   sqrt(z + 1) 

		B. Once a function f(x) is defined, think of x as an input and f(x) as the output.
		In any function, any one input gives at most one output.
		But different inputs can give the same output
		ex: If h(x) = |x + 3|, then h(-4) = 1 = h(2)

		C. The set of all allowed inputs for a function is a function's domain.
		For example (1), the domain is all real numbers
		For example (2), the domain is all numbers greater than -1
		
		D. The set of a function's outputs is the function's range.
		ex(1): h(x) = |x + 3| Range: Any number greater than or equal to 0
		ex(2): a(x) = 9x - 5 for 0 <= x <= 10 Range: -5 <= y <= 85	

	Graphing
		A. Coordinate Plane with X-axis (horizontal) and Y-axis (vertical). Origin O.
		Four quadrants: 
			|
		    II  |  I
			|
		  ------+------
			|
		    III |  IV
			|
		
		B. Linear equation for all points: y = mx + b
		m = Slope
		b = y-intercept
		y-intercept = when x = 0
		x-intercept = when y = 0
	
			      y2 - y1 
		C. Slope m = ---------
			      x2 - x1
		
		D. Equation of a line through two points: y - y1 = m(x - x1)
			requires two points (x2, y2) and (x1, x2) 
	
		E. Solution Cases
		Unique Solution 	  = The two lines intersect at a point
		Infinitely Many Solutions = The two lines are equivalent and are on top of eachother
		No Solution		  = The two lines are parallel and never intesect

	Formulas and Measurement Conversion
		A. Formula - an algebraic equation whose variables have specific meanings. 
			ex: F = ma, F being force, m being mass, and a being acceleration
	
		B. Any quantitative relationship between units of measure can be written as a formula
			ex(1): Since 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, the formula m = 1000k can stand for the relationship between kilometers (k) and meters (m).
			ex(2): The formula C = 5/9(F - 32) is the relationship between Temerature and Celcius

		C. Except for units of time, a GMAT question that requires converting one unit of measure to another will give the relationship between those units
			ex: A train travels at a constant 25 meters per second. How many kilometers does it trabel in 5 minutes? (1 kilometer = 1,000 meters)
			sol: In 1 minute the train travels (25)(60) = 1,500 meters, so in 5 minutes it travels 7,500 meters. Since 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters, we find 7,500 meters = 7.5 kilometers

	Ratio and Proportion
		A. The Ratio of a number x to a nonzero number y may be written as x : y, or x/y, or x to y. The order of a ratio's terms is important. 
			x      y
		       --- /= ---
			y      x
		ex: The ratio of 2 to 3 may be written as 2:3, or 2/3, or 2 to 3
		    The ratio of the number of months with exactly 30 days to the number of months with exactly 31 days is 4:7, not 7:4

		B. A proportion is an equation between two ratios.
		ex: 2:3 = 8:12 is a proportion

		C. One way to solve for an unknown in a proportion is to cross multiply, then solve the resulting equation.
		ex:  2     n
		    --- = ----   cross multiply to get 3n = 24, n = 8
		     3     12		

		D. Some word problems can be solved using ratios
		ex: If 5 shirts cost a total of $44, then what is the total cost of 8 shirts at the same cost per shirt?
		sol: If c is the cost of the 8 shirts, then  5      8
							    ---- = ---
							     44     c
			cross multiplying gives 5c = 8 * 44
						5c = 352
						c  = 352 / 5 = 70.4
			thus, the 8 shirts cost a total of $70.40


	Fractions
		A. In a fraction n/d, n is the numerator and d is the denominator.
		   A fraction's denominator can never be 0, because division by 0 is undefined.
		
		B. Equivalent fractions stand for the same number.
		   Greates Common Divisor (gcd): the largest factor common to that numerator and denominator
		   Doing this is called reducing each fraction to its lowest terms.

		ex: 8         14     8/36 = 4/18 = 2/9
		   ----  and ----    14/63 = 2/9, thus they are equivalent
		    36	      63

		C. To add or subtract two fractions with the same denominator, just add or subtract the numerators, leaving the denominators the same

		ex:  3  +  4   =   3 + 4     7  		 5     2     5 - 2     3
		    ---   ---     ------- = ---       and       --- - --- = ------- = ---
		     5     5         5       5			 7     7       7       7

		D. To add or subtract two fractions with different denominators, first express them as fractions with the same denominator
		ex: To add 3/5 and 4/7, multiply the numerator and denominator of 3/5 by 7 to get 21/35.
					multiply the numerator and denominator of 4/7 by 5 to get 20/35.
		    Since both fractions now have the same denominator 35, you can easily add them:
			 3     4     21     20     41
			--- + --- = ---- + ---- = ----
			 5     7     35     35     35	

		E. To multiply two fractions, multiply their numerators, and also multiply their denominators.
		   2     4     2 * 4     8
		  --- * --- = ------- = ---- 
		   3	 7     3 * 7	 21

		F. The reciprocal of a fraction n/d is d/n, if n and d are not 0.
		ex: The reciprocal of 4/7 is 7/4

		G. To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal
		   2     4     2     7     14     7
		  --- ÷ --- = --- * --- = ---- = ---
		   3     7     3     4     12     6

		H. A mixed number is written as an integer next to a fraction. It equals the integer plus the fraction
		ex: The mixed number 	   2	     2
					7 --- = 7 + ---
					   3         3

		I. To write a mixed number as a fraction, multiply the integer part of the mixed number by the denominator of the fractional part. Add this product to the numerator. Then put this sum over the denominator.
			2     (7 * 3) + 2      23
	             7 --- = -------------- = ----
		        3           3		3

	Percents
		A. The word percent means per hundred or number out of 100
		ex: 37 percent, or 37%, of the houses in a city are painted blue means that 37 houses per 100 in the city are painted blue
	
		B. A percent may be greater than 100
		ex: The number of blue houses in a city is 150% of the number of red houses means the city has 150 blue houses for every 100 red houses. Since 150:100 = 3:2, this is the same as saying the city has 3 blue houses for every 2 red houses

		C. A percent need not be an integer
		ex: Saying the number of pink houses in a city is 0.5% of the number of blue houses means the city has 0.5 of a pink house for every 100 blue houses. Since 0.5: 100 = 1:200, this is the same as saying the city has 1 pink house for every 200 blue houses.

		ex: Likewise, saying that the number of orange houses is 12.5 of the number of blue houses means the ratio of orange houses to blue houses is 12.5:100 = 1:8. Therefore, there is 1 orange house for every 8 blue houses.

	Converting Decimals, Fractions, and Percents
		A. Decimals can be rewritten as fractions or sums of fractions.
		ex:              3       2       1       321
			0.321 = ---- + ----- + ------ = ------
				 10     100     1000     1000


				  0       3       2         1        321
			0.0321 = ---- + ----- + ------ + ------- = -------
				  10     100     1000     10000     10000

				    5       6      156
			1.56 = 1 + ---- + ----- = -----
				    10     100     100

		B. To rewrite a percent as a fraction, write the percent number as the numerator over a denominator 100. To rewrite a percent as a decimal, move the decimal point in the percent two places to the left and drop the percent sign. To rewrite a decimal as a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right, then ad a percent sign

		        37			   300				0.5
		37% = ----- = 0.37         300% = ----- = 3		0.5% = ----- = 0.005
		       100			   100				100

		C. To find a certain percent of a number, multiply the number py the percent expressed as a fraction or decimal
		ex:
			20% of 90 = 90 (20/100) = 90(1/5) = 90/5 = 18
			20% of 90 = 90(0.2) = 18

			250% of 80 = 80(250/100) = 80(2.5) = 200
			0.5% of 12 = 12(0.5/100) = 12(0.005) = 0.06	

	Working with Decimals, Fractions, and Percents
		A. To find the percent increase or decrease from one quantity to another, first find the amount of increase or decrease. Then divide this amount by the original quantity. Write this quotient as a percent.
		ex: Suppose a price increases from $24 to $30. 
		To find the percent increase, find the amount of increase: $30 - $24 = $6
		Divide this $6 by the original price of $24 to find the percent increase: 6/24 = 0.25 = 25%
		
		    Suppose a price falls from $20 to $24.
		The amount of decrease is $30 - $24 = $6.
		So, the percent decrease is 6/30 = 0.20 = 20%

		Notice the percent increase from 24 to 30 (25%) doesn't equal the percent decrease from 30 to 24 (20%)

		A percent increase or decrease may be greater than 100%
		ex: Suppose a house's price in 2018 was 300% of its price in 2003. By what percent did the price increase?
		sol: if n is the price in 2003, the percent increase is 
			|  (3n - n)  |   |  2n  |
			| ---------- | = | ---- | = 2, or 200%
			|      n     |   |   n  |  

		B. A price discounted by n percent price is (100 - n) percent of the original price.
		ex: A cusomter paid $24 for a dress. If the customer got a 25% discount off the original price of the dress, what was the original price before the discount?
		sol: The discounted price is (100 - 25 = 75)% of the original price. So, if p is the original price, 0.75p = $24 is the discounted price. Thus, p = ($24 / 0.75) = $32, the original price before the discount
		
		Two discounts can be dcombined to make a larger discount
		ex: A price is discounted 20%. Then this reduced price is discounted another 30%. These two discounts together make an overall discount of what percent?
		
		sol: If p is the original price, then 0.8p is the price after the first discount. The price after the second discount is (0.7)(0.8) p = 0.56p. The overall discount is 100% - 56% = 44%

		C. Gross profit equals revenues minues expenses, or selling price minus cost.
		ex: A certain appliance costs a merchant $30. At what price should the merchant seel the appliance to make a gross profit of 50% of the appliance's cost?
		sol: The merchant should sell the appliance for a price s such that s - 30 = (0.5)(30). So, s = $30 + $15 = $45

		D. Simple annual interest on a loan or investment is based only on the iriginal loan or investment amount (the principal). It equals (principal) * (interest Rate) * (time).		
		ex: If $8,000 is invested at 6% simple annual interest, how much interest is earned after 3 months?
		sol: Since the annual interest rate is 6%, the interest for 1 year is (0.06)($8,000) = $480. A year has 12 months, so the interest earned in 3 months is (3/12)($480) = $120.

		E. Compound interest is based on the principal plus any interest already earned. 
		   Compound interest over n periods = (principal) * (1 + interest per period)^n - principal.
		ex: If $10,000 is invested at 10% annual interest, compounded every 6 months, what is the balance after 1 year?
		sol: Since the interest is compounded every 6 months, or twice a year, the interest rate for each 6-month periodis 5%, half of the 10% annual rate. So, the balance after the first 6 months is 10,000 + (10,000)(0.05) = $10,500.
		For the second 6 months, the interest is based on the $10,500 balance after the first 6 months.
		So, the balance after 1 year is 10,500 + (10,500)(0.05) = $11,025
		The balance after one year can also be written as 10,000 * (1 + 0.10/2)² dollars.

		F. To solve some word problems with percents and fractions, you can organize the information in a table.
		ex: In a production lot, 40% of the toys are red, and the rest are green. Half of the toys are small, and half are large. If 10% of the toys are red and small, and 40 toys are green and large, how many of the toys are red and large?
	
		sol: First make a table to organize the information

			red | green | total |
		small | 10% |       |  50%  |
		------|-----|-------|-------|
		large |     |       |  50%  |
		------|-----|-------|-------|
		total | 40% |  60%  | 100%  |

			red | green | total |
		small | 10% |  40%  |  50%  |
		------|-----|-------|-------|
		large | 30% |  20%  |  50%  |
		------|-----|-------|-------|
		total | 40% |  60%  | 100%  |

		The number of large green toys, 40, is 20% of the total number of toys (n), so 0.20n = 40. Thus, the total number of toys n = 200. So, 30% of the 200 toys are red and large. Since (0.3)(200) = 60, we find that 60 of the toys are red and large. 

	Rate, Work, and Mixture Problems
		A. The distance an object travels is its average speed multiplied by the time it takes to travel that distance. That is, distance = rate * time.
		ex: How many kilometers did a car travel in 4 hours at an average speed of 70 kilometers per hour?
		sol: Since distance = rate * time, multiply 70 km/hour * 4 hours to find that the car went 280 kilometers.

		B. To find an object's average travel speed, divide the total travel distance by the total travel time.
		ex: On a 600-kilometer trip, a car went half the distance at an average speed of 60 kilometers per hour (kph), and the other half at an average speed of 100 lph. The car didn't stop between the two halves of the trip. What was the car's average speed over the whole trip?
		sol: First find the total travel time. For the first 300 kilometers, the car went at 60 kph, taking 300/60 = 5 hours. For the second 300 kilometers, the car went at 100 kph, taking 300 / 100 = hours. So, the total travel time was 5 + 3 = 8 hours. The car's average speed was 600 kilometers / 8 hours = 75 kph.

		C. A work problem usually says how fast certain individuals work and asks you to find how fast they work together, or vice versa. 
					     1     1     1
		The basic formula for work  --- + --- = ---
					     r     s     h
		where r is how long an amount of work takes a certain individual, s is how long that much work takes a different individual, and h is how long that much work takes both individuals working at the same time.
		ex: Suppose one machine takes 4 hours to maek 1,00 bolts, and asecond machine takes 5 hours to make 1,000 bolts. How many hours do both machines working at the same time take to make 1,000 bolts?
		sol:     1     1     1
			--- + --- = ---
			 4     5     h

			 5      4      1	
			---- + ---- = ---
			 20     20     h

			 9      1			20	 2
			---- = ---   =   9h = 20   =   ---- = 2 ---
			 20     h			 9       9

		Working together, the two machines can make 1,000 bolts in 2 2/9 hours.

		Using the same formula to find how long it takes one individual to do an amount of work alone.
		ex: Suppose Art and Rita both working at the same time takes 4 hours to do an amount of work, and Art alone takes 6 hours to do taht much work. Then how many hours does Rita alone take to do that much work?
		sol:
			 1     1     1
			--- + --- = ---
			 6     R     4

			 1     1     1      1
			--- = --- - --- = ----
			 R     4     6     12

			R = 12
		Rita alone takes 12 hours to do that much work.

		D. In mixture problems, substances with different properties are mixed, and you must find the mixture's properties.
		ex: If 6 kilograms of nuts that cost $1.20 per kilogram are mixed with 2 kilograms of nuts that cost $1.60 per kilogram, how much does the mixture cost per kilogram?
		sol: The 8 kilograms of nuts cost a total of 6($1.20) + 2($1.60) = $10.40. So, the cost per kilogram is $10.40 /8 = $1.30.
	
		Some mixture problems use percents
		ex: How many liters of a solution that is 15% salt must be added to 5 liters of a solution that is 8% salt to make a solution that is 10% salt?
		sol: Let n be the needed number of liters of the 15% solution. The amount of salt in n liters of 15% solution is 0.15n. The amount of salt in the 5 liters of 8% solution is (0.08)(5). These amounts add up to the amount of salt in the 10% mixture, whish is 0.10(n _ 5). So,
		0.15n + 0.08(5) = 0.10(n + 5)
		       15n + 40 = 10n + 50
			     5n = 10
			      n = 2 liters
		So, 2 liters of the 15% salt solution must be added to the *% solution to make the 10% solution.
		
	Statistics
		A. a common statistical measure is the average or (arithmetic) mean, a type of center for a set of numbers. The average or mean of n numbers is the sum of the n numbers divided by n.
		ex: The average of the 5 numbers 6, 4, 7, 10, and 4 is (6 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 4) / 5 = 31/5 = 6.2.

		B. The median is another type of center for a set of numbers. To find the median of n numbers, order the numbers from the least to greatest. If n is odd, the median is the middle number in the list. But if n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The median may be less than, equal to, or greater than the mean of the same numbers.
		ex: To find the median of the 5 numbers 6, 4, 7, 10, and 4, order them from least to greatest: 4, 4, 6, 7, 10. the median is 6, the middle number in this list.
		The median of the 6 numbers 4, 6, 6, 8, 9, 12 is (6 + 8)/2 = 7. But the mean of these 6 numbers is (4 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 12)/6 = 45/6 = 7.5

		Often about half the numbers in a set are less than the median, and about half are greater than the median. but not always.
		ex: For the 15 numbers 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, and 10, th median is 7. Only 2/15 of the numbers are less than the median.

		C. The mode of a list of numbers is the number that occurs the most often in the list
		ex: The mode of the list of numbers 1, 3, 6, 4, 3, 5 is 3, since 3 is the only number that occurs more than once in the list
	
		A list of numbers may have more than one mode
		ex: The list 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7, 10, 10, 10, 20 has two modes, 3 and 10.

		D. There are many ways to measure how spread out or dispersed numerical data are. The simplest measure of dispersion is the range, which is the greatest value in the data minus the lease value
		ex: The range of the 5 numbers 11, 10, 5, 13, 21 is 21 - 5 = 16. Notice the range depends on only 2 of the numbers.

		E. Another common measure of dispersion is the standard deviation. Generally, the farther the numbers spread away from the mean, the greater the standard deviation. To find the standard deviation of n numbers:
			1. Find their arithmetic mean,
			2. Find the differences between the mean and each of the n numbers,
			3. Square each difference,
			4. Find the average of the squared differences
			5. Take the nonnegative square root of this average

		Ex: Lets use the table below to find the standard deviation of the 5 numbers 0, 7, 8, 10, 10 which have the mean 7.
		
			x    |      x - 7      |          (x - 7)²	  |
		-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|		The standard deviation is sqrt(68/5) =~ 3.7
			0    |       -7        |             49           |
		-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|		The standard deviation depends on every number in the set, but more farther from the mean. This is why stadnard deviation is smaller
			7    |        0        |              0           |		for a set of data grouped closer around its mean.
		-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
			8    |        1        |              1           |		As a second example, consider the numbers 6, 6, 6.5, 7.5, 9, which also have the mean 7. these numbers are grouped closer around the mean 7
		-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|		than the numbers in the first example. That makes the standard deviation in this second example only about 1.1, far below the standard	
	               10    |        3        |              9           |		deviation of 3.7 in the first example
		-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
		       10    |        3        |              9           |
		-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
		              Total	       |             68           |

		F. How many times a value occurs in a data set is its frequency in the set. When different data values have different frequencies, a frequency distribution can help show how the values are distributed.
		ex: Consider this data set of 20 numbers

			|	-4	|	0	|	0	|	-3	|	-2	|	-1	|	-1	|	0	|	-1	|	-4	|
			|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
			|	-1	|	-5	|	0	|	-2	|	0	|	-5	|	-2	|	0	|	0	|	-1	|

		We can show its frequency distribution in a table listing each data value x and x's frequency f:
		
				|	Data Value x	|	Frequency f	|		This frequency distribution table makes computing statistical measures easier:
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|		
				|	    -5		|	    2    	|			 (-5)(2) + (-4)(2) + (-3)(1) + (-2)(3) + (-1)(5) + (0)(7)	
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|		Mean: = ---------------------------------------------------------- ~= 1.7
				|	    -4		|	    2    	|						   20
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|
				|	    -3		|	    1    	|		Median: -1 (the average of 10th and 11th numbers)
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|		
				|	    -2		|	    3    	|		Mode: 0 (the number that occurs most ofter)
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|
				|	    -1		|	    5    	|		Range: 0 - (-5) = 5
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|
				|	     0		|	    7    	|					    (-5 + 1.6)²(2) + (-4 + 1.6)² + ... + (0 + 1.6)²(7)
				|-----------------------|-----------------------|		Standard deviation: sqrt ( ---------------------------------------------------- ) ~= 1.7
				|	  Total		|	   20    	|								    20
