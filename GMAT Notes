	Quantatative
		Algebra and Basic Arithmetic - Can be brushed up in Math Review Section

Quick Tip (Read Before Exam)
	Finish the Test, dont get stuck on a question
	Best Guess and move on
	I can bookmark as many questions as I like, to see how they did later
	I can only change answers to three questions per section

General Notes and Ideas
	The first 10 questions do not determine the exam, it will balance out over the course of the test
	Calculator not allowed, so when studying, do not use one

Verbal Reasoning
	What Reading Comprehension Questions Measure
		Identify Stated Idea 
			- understand the passage as a whole and its constituent parts.
			- No need to do anything further with the information

		Identify Inferred Idea
			- use information in a passage for purposes
			- inferring additional information or the basis of what is given
			- applying the information to further contexts
			- critiquing the views expressed in the passage
			- evaluating the ways in which the writing is structured

	Five Types of Reading Comprehension Questions
		Main Idea Questions
			- Recognize an accurate statement of the main idea
			- Identify the authors primary purpose in writing it
			- Assign a title that accurately summarizes the main idea	

		Supporting Idea Questions
			- Asked about facts cited in a passage
			- Specific content of the arguments authors present ot support thier views
			- Descriptive details that support or elobrate on the main idea
			- Determine the meanings of individual sentences and paragraphs that contribute to the meaning of the passage as a whole
			- Pro Tip: See them as asking for the main point of one small part of the passage
		
		Inference Questions
			- Ideas that aren't explicitly stated in a passage but I can reasonably conclude are correct
			- Determine further conclusions or subtle meanings those words imply
			- "If I accept the truth of what the author says, what else would have to be-or would most likely be-true?"
			- Infer, based on context, the intended meaning of a word used figuratively or in a nonstandard way.

		Application Questions
			- The ability to figure out the relationships between situations or ideas a passage presents and other situations or ideas the passage doesn't directly address.
			- Examples:
				- Describe a hypothetical situation and ask you to infer from the passage what the author's opinion of that situation would most likely be
				- Ask you to recognize a situation or concept that is analogous to a situation or concept expressed in the passage
				- Require you to apply a principle expressed or implied in the passage to a different situation
				- Ask you to recognize implications that a bit of new, hyupothetical information would have for the reasoning in the passage.

		Evaluation
			- Analyze and evaluate a passage's organization and logiv.
			- How a passage is constructed or what strategies authors' use to try to persuade readers toa ccept their assertions
			- Assess the strengths and weaknesses of thier arguments

	Critical Reasoning
		Analysis - test skill in understanding a piece of logical reasoning as a whole and identifying the relationships among its constituent parts
		Construction - forming cogent arguments, ex: determine additional information that can be inferred from given info, or what additional info would be needed for an argument to work
		Critique - challenging the cogency of arguments, identifying strengths and weaknesses, determining how they could be improved
		Plan - designed to test skill in constructing and critiquing arguments about proposed courses of action.	

	Types of Critical Reasoning Questions
		Argument Construction
			- Basic argument structure
			- Properly drawn conclusions
			- Underlying assumptions
			- Well-supported explanatory hypotheses
			- Parallels between structurally similar arguments
		
		Argument Evaluation
			- Factors that would stregnthen or weaken the argument
			- Reasoning errors committed in making the argument
			- Aspects of the method by which the argument proceeds
		
		Questions about formulating and evaluating a plan of action
			- The relative appropriateness, effectiveness, or efficiency of different plans of action
			- Factors that would strengthen or weaken the prospects of succuess for a propsed plan of action
			- Assumptions underlying a proposed plan of action
	
	Strategies
		Be certain I understand the statement or set of statements on which a question is based
			Pay attention to :
			- What is put forward as factual information
			- What is not said but necessarily follows from what is said
			- What is claimed to follow from facts that have been put forward
			- How well those claims are substantiated
		If a question is based on an argument, identify which part of the argument is its conclusion
		Determine exactly what the question is asking
		Read all the answer choices carefully
		
Data Insights
	Data Types
		Text passages
		Tables
		Graphics
		Some combination
		
	Strategies
		Don't expect to be completely familiar with the material presented in Multi-Source Reasoning sets
		Analyze each source of info carefully, as the questions require detailed understanding of the information presented
		Read the quesitons carefully, making sure you understand whta they ask
		Examine the table and accompanying text to determine the type of information provided
		Read the question carefully
		Read each phrase, statement, numerical value, or algebraic expression carefully to determine the data analysis required
		Judge each phrase, statemnet, numerical value, or algebraic expression carefully on the basis of the condition specified
		
	Data Sufficiency
		Measure
			- Analyze a quantitative problem
			- Recognize which information is relevant
			- Determine at what point there is enough information to solve the problem

		Directions
			Each problem consists of a question and two statements (1) and (2)
			Using the data given int eh statements, plus basic knowdlege, decide whether you've been given enough data in the statements to answer the question asked
				- (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient to answer the question
				- (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient to answer the question
				- BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient
				- EACH statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question
				- Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient to answer the question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.
			Node: If a Data Sufficiency problem asks for a specific value, the data in the statements are sufficient only when tehy allow you to deteremine one precise value ratehr than a range of values
		
		Strategies
			Determine whether it's necessary to solve the problem
				- The answers I will select ask only if I have enough information. In some cases you may need to work the problem through
				- First consider if each statement separately gives enough information to solve the problem. disregard the other statement when evaluating
				- If either, or both, of the statements gives enough to solve the porblem, then tahts your answer
				- If neither statement ALONE is sufficient, consider the information in both statemnet (1) and statement (2) together.
			Decide whether the problem allows only one value or a range of values
			Avoid making unwarranted assumptions based on geometric figures
				- Figures are not necessarily drawn to scale
				- Ex: if a figure described as a rectangle looks as if it might be a square, don't assume it's a square just by looking at the figure
			
Full Quantitative Study
	Linear Equations	
		C. If two linear equations with the same two unknowns are equivalent, they have infinitely many solutions
			ex: 3x-y=6 and 6x-2y=12 -> Infinitely Many solutions.

		   If two linear equations with the same two unknowns aren't equivalent, they have at most one solution
			ex: 3x-y=6 and 4x-3y=12 -> at most one solution

		   If in solving them, you get
			0=0 or 1=1 : Infinite many solutions
			1/=0 : (Contradiction) No solution	
			Ex: 3x + 4y = 17
			    6x + 8y = 35
			Ans: No solution
			Why: The first line implies that 6x + 8y = 34 and that is just not the case here
			     No values of x and y can satisfy both equations

		   If neither a trivial equation nor a contradiction is reached, a unique solution can be found

		D. Solving By Subtitution
		   Ex: 3x + 2y = 11
		        x - y = 2

		       equation (2) converts ->  x = y + 2
		       plug (2) into (1) -> 3(y + 2) + 2y = 11
					    3y + 6 + 2y = 11
					    5y = 5
					    y = 1
			with y = 1, I can plug y into x - y = 2 -> x - 1 = 2 -> x = 3
		       
		E. Solving By Subtraction
		   Ex: 6x + 5y = 29 --> 18x + 15y = 87
		       4x + 3y = -6 --> 20x - 15y =-30
			              +_______________
					38x +  0y = 57 -> x = 3/2	
			With x, solve for y
